This is the example code from the book All That Internet Crap (&copy; 2020 True Anomaly LLC) and associated documentation.

# Chapter 2
In this chapter we learned about HTML and CSS. The code here consists of a single HTML file, called index.html, and a CSS file, called style.css that are linked with a link tag. 

Download the code using the Clone or Download button, then select "Download Zip", unzip the file, and double click on the index.html file. It should open in your default web browser. You can view the raw code by right clicking anywhere in the browser and clicking "View Page Source". It shuld open a new tab displaying the HTML code. The style.css file will be a blue link you can click on to open that file as well. With all three tabs open, compare the raw code to the rendered code to see the basics of CSS styling HTML in action.
